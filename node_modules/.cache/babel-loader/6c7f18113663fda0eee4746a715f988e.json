This will acquire our propre dataset and some basic knowledge\n                    of machine learning. We're not going to get into that this time. Generally, we will train the model in TensorFlow for python. The format of the trained model will be SavedModel.    \n                </p>\n\n                <h4>Conversion of the model</h4>\n                <p>\n                    Since the environment of React Native is Javascriptwe, we have to convert the SavedModel in .js format with <a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter'>TF.js converter</a> to get the model in .js. \n                    So why we don't use the js format of pre-trained model from the hub ? Let's firstly see the config parameters of the converter and explain why.\n                    After installation as guided, we can convert the model with these conversion flags:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>input_format=tf_saved_model</li>\n                        <li>output_format=tfjs_graph_model</li>\n                        <li>weight_shard_size_bytes= 4MB/8MB/...</li>\n                    </ul> \n                    The converter will generate a model.json with a bunch of group1-shard1ofN.bin files. The model.json represents the architecture of the model and the group-shard.bin files are the weights of the model. Since the tfjs-react-native package only supports one group1-shard.bin file, we have to set the flag weight_shard_size_bytes\n                    as large as it could to make sure that only one group-shard.bin file will be generated. Actually, the model of .js format downloaded from the hub contain piles of group-shard.bin files which can not be used in React-Native.             \n                </p>\n\n                <h4>Deployment in React Native</h4>\n                <p>Firstly, we will put the model files in local file system so that the app can read the files offline. Then we will create a component in React Native called Camera.\n                    This component controls the following two functions:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>takePicture : Take and process the pictures  </li>\n                        <li>callModelPrediction: Apply the model stored in the file system</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    In the function takePicture, we will firstly call RNCamera to take a picture of the object. We will then process the image to meet the needs of the model input.\n                    We will take the following steps:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Resize the image</li>\n                        <li>Reformatting the image : datatype, encoding format, Pixel range</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    For exemple, the model we use usually requires an image size 1*224*224*3, float32 datatype, tensor encoding format, pixel range[0,1], then we need to take the following steps:\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Crop the image to 224*224*3 with ImageEditor</li>\n                        <li>Convert data encoding format from base64 to Uint8Array, and then from Uint8Array to Tensor Object</li>\n                        <li>Normalize the pixel range from [0,255] to [0,1]</li>\n                        <li>Convert datatype to float32</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                After following these steps, we can get an image which meet the model input : [1*224*224*3], float32,Tensor Object,  Pixel values [0, 1]. \n                Now this processed image can be used as the input to call the model for making a prediction. There are no complicated processing steps in this step.\n                Just remember the most important thing : Model calling method should match the model converter process. That means, we should use tf.loadGraphModel to call the model\n                since we convert the model tf_saved_model to model tfjs_graph_model. If the output of the model is not a graph model, we can't use the method tf.loadGraphModel.\n                </p>\n                <p>The model will output the result after 5 or 10 seconds after calling. The output is an array which represents each possibility for each class of objects.\n                    We can extract the maximum possibility and its index to do further processing, for exemple, comparing with the database to find the corresponding product name\n                </p>\n\n                <h4>Demo</h4>\n                <p>\n                Here I'm showing an app made for a company that can identify specific products offline. It includes an image classification model that recognizes 14 products. \n                For some products, the recognition accuracy is almost 100%. Of course, the accuracy of the model depends heavily on the dataset, and the angle of the shot will also have an impact on the results.\n                Anyway, this was a bold and encouraging experiment for me. I hope this article can help you with how to apply machine learning to your React-Native application!
